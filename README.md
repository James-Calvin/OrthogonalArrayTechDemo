# Tech demo

This is a tech demo of how orthogonal arrays may be used to find optimum values
among various desired responses.

# Future

The following are features that may be added to improve the usability of the
this application:

- Allow for multiple observations per run.
- Handle different experiment design configurations (L9, L16b, L27, L32b, L50, L64b)
- Detect if levels are discrete or continuous
  - List discrete as bar graph in descending order by rank
  - Curve-fitting for continuous values
- Add additional analyses
